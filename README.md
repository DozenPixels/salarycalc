Currently Using AngularJS v1.6.x

Compatible with legacy Angular versions and current versions.

No database support available yet, but is scheduled to be implemented in the next full release, via Parse REST API or Mongo DB.

Built using Angular best practices, however a bug is currently causing issues with ngRepeat, thus current build is forced to work around it. Fix upcoming.
